# Map of visibility from Pilot Knob State Nature Sanctuary
This map is designed to show the visibility range from the outlook of Pilot Knob at Pilot Knob State Nature Sanctuary. While this map is to serve as no replacement to the real experience, it is intended to be supplementary to what hikers can see from the lookout point at the end of the trail. This map can also verify to the user what they can or cannot see from the outlook on Pilot Knob, as there could be some areas not identifiable from this map.
