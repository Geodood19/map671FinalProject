# Map of visibility overlap from popular destinations in Red River Gorge

This map is designed to show overlapping visibilities from popular hiking destinations within Red River Gorge. While this map is to serve as no replacement to the real experience, it is intended to be supplementary to what hikers can see from these destinations and where overlap from these viewpoints can occur.

### Project Background

Viewshed analyses give a great understanding of visibility for analysis. Viewshed analyses can be constructed to give an understanding of what is visible from tourist attractions in national parks, such as the [observation tower](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/clingmansdome.htm) which is constructed atopa Clingman's Dome in Smoky Mountains National Park, or the [Grand Canyon West Skywalk](https://grandcanyonwest.com/things-to-do/skywalk/) which hangs over the Grand Canyon. Viewshed analyses can also be performed in multiple locations to give developers an understanding of where might be the best location for such tourist attractions to maximize views. Viewsheds from these locations are analyzed at the respective elevation of the features, which is the additional height above ground level. 

Viewsheds can also be conducted to give the viewer an understanding of what they could see during ideal weather conditions and how far they could potentially see. Interstingly, the type of viewshed analysis conducted for this purpose gives a general understanding of what hiking destination in Red River Gorge could provide the *most* visibility in Red River Gorge. If hikers were wanting to hike to a particular location, or see a particular area within Red River Gorge, they could opt to choose a different hiking trail over others because of this.

### Purpose

This project was intended to give the viewer an understanding of visibilities from various overlooks throughout Red River Gorge. These destinations were chosen based on popular hiking destinations as well as with the intent to show overlapping visibilities. Read more about viewshed analysis 

### Mapmaking Process

Example of in process map ![in process image](filepath)

You can describe the mapmapking process in this section, including images where it helps to describe the process.

You can also use some lists, and here's some formatting ideas.

1. **Example bold**
2. *Example italics*
3. 
4. 

### Summary

What are the key findings to take from your map and the overall mapmaking process?
