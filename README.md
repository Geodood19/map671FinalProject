# Map of visibility overlap from popular destinations in Red River Gorge
This map is designed to show overlapping visibilities from popular hiking destinations within Red River Gorge. While this map is to serve as no replacement to the real experience, it is intended to be supplementary to what hikers can see from these destinations and where overlap from these viewpoints can occur.
